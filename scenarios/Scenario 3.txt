Scenario

The Quality Sweater Company sells hand-knitted sweaters. The company is planning to print a catalog of its
products and undertake a direct mail campaign. The cost of printing the catalog is $20,000 plus $.10 per catalog.
The cost of mailing each catalog (including postage, order forms, and buying names from a mail-order database) is
$0.15. In addition, the company plans to include direct reply envelopes in its mailing and incurs a $.20 in extra costs
for each direct mail envelope used by a respondent. The average size of a customer order is $40, and the company’s
variable cost per order (primarily due to labor and material costs) averages about 80% of the order’s value - that is
$32. The company plans to mail 100,000 catalogs. It wants to develop a spreadsheet model to answer the following
questions:

1. How does a change in the response rate affect profit?
2. For what response rate does the company break even?
3. Ifthe company estimates a response rate of 3%, should it proceed with the mailing?

4. How does the presence of uncertainty affect the usefulness of the model?
