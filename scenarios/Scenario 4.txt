Scenario

B&N Bookstore, with many locations across the United States, places orders for all the latest books and then
distributes them to its individual bookstores. B&N needs a model to help it order the appropriate number of any
title. For example, B&N plans to order a popular new hardback novel, which it will sell for $30. It can purchase any
number of this book from the publisher, but due to quantity discounts, the nit cost for all books it orders depends
â€˜on the number ordered. Specifically, if the number ordered is less than 1000, the unit cost is $24. After each 1000,
the unit costs drops: to $23 for at least 1000 copies; to $22.25 for at least 2000; to $21.75 for at least 3000; and to
$21.30 (the lowest possible unit cost) for at least 4000. B&N is very uncertain about the demand for this book - it
estimates that demand could be anywhere from 500 to 4500. Also, as with most hardback novels, this one will
eventually come out in paperback. Therefore, if B&N has any hardbacks left when the paperback comes out, it will
put them on sale for $10, at which price it believes all the leftovers will be sold.

How many copies of this hardback novel should B&N order from the publisher?
