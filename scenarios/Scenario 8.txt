Alarge drug company, Gopher Drugs, is deciding whether one of its new drugs, Iguazu, is worth pursuing. Iguazu is
in the final stages of development and will be ready to enter the market one year from now. The final cost of
development, to be incurred at the beginning of year 1, is $9.3M. The company estimates that the demand for
Iguazu will gradually grow and then decline over its useful lifetime of 20 years. Specifically the company expects ts
gross margins (revenue minus cost) to be $1.2M in year 1, then to increase at an annual rate of 10% through year,
and finally to decrease at an annual rate of 5% through year 20. Gopher Drugs wants to develop a spreadsheet
model of its 20-year cash flows, assuming its cash flows, other than the initial development cost, are incurred at
the end of the respective years. Using an annual discount rate of 129 for purposes of calculating net present value
(NPV), the drug company wants to answer the following questions:

1. Isthe drug worth pursuing, or should Gopher Drugs abandon it now and not incur the $9.3M development
cost?

2. How do changes in the model change the answer to the prior question?
