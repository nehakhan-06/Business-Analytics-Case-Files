Scenario

The company PETROL sells designer jeans made from cotton with steel buttons, rivets, and zippers. The current prices for materials

and labor are shown in the table below.

Resource Unit Cost

Cotton $1.65 per kilogram
Hardware (buttons, rivets, zipper) $1.42 per set
Labor $12 per hour

Manufacturing a single pair of jeans requires 1.2 kilogram of cotton, 1 set of hardware, and 4.5 hours of labor.

Set up a spreadsheet to model this scenario in Excel.
