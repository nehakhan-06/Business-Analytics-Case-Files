Scenario

You are thinking of opening a small copy shop. It costs $5000 to rent a copier for a year, and it costs $0.03 per copy to operate the
copier. Other fixed costs of running the store will amount to $400 per month. You plan to charge an average of $.10 per copy and the
store will be open 365 days per year. Each copier can make up to 100,000 copies per year. You expect that the demand could be
anywhere from 500 to 2000 copies per day.
